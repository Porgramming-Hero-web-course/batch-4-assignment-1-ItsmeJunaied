## Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript

Union and intersection types are key features in TypeScript that help make your code more flexible and safer.

### **Union Types**

Union types allow a variable to hold multiple types. For example, a variable can be either a `string` or a `number`, providing flexibility while ensuring only valid types are used. This helps prevent errors when handling different types of input.

### **Intersection Types**

Intersection types combine multiple types into one. This means an object must include all the properties from the types being combined. Intersection types are useful when you need to create an object that has features from different sources or interfaces.



Using union and intersection types together enables you to write more flexible, type-safe code, making your applications less prone to runtime errors and easier to maintain.
